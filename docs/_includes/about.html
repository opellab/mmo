                    In the context of personalized psychiatry, psychiatric diagnostics face the challenging task of precisely capturing the complexity of mental disorders and developing individualized treatment approaches. Traditional classification systems, such as DSM-5 and ICD-11, which heavily rely on symptomatic criteria, often reach their limits in this regard. These systems are structured to categorize mental disorders into rigid, predefined categories, which often fail to adequately represent the diversity and dynamics of these conditions. This is particularly evident in patients with complex symptom constellations and comorbidities, where diagnostic precision suffers and tailored therapeutic approaches become more difficult.

                    In addition to classification systems, there are other knowledge representation systems in psychiatry, such as ontologies, taxonomies, and increasingly, network analyses and dimensional models, which aim to represent the multifaceted and interactive nature of mental disorders. However, a central issue is that these various knowledge bases have often been used in isolation. Comprehensive networking and integration of these systems are currently limited, hindering the development of truly personalized and dynamic diagnostics. Literature highlights this as a critical barrier that must be overcome to make truly individualized diagnoses and develop treatments within the framework of personalized medicine. This requires the development of new, integrative approaches that allow for deviation from rigid classification systems and adequately consider the complex interactions between genetic, neurobiological, cognitive, and environmental factors.

                    The development of the Meta Mesh Ontology (MMO) aims to unify the various knowledge bases in psychiatry within a coherent and interoperable framework. Building on the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the MMO provides a unified, philosophically grounded foundation that ensures both structural and semantic consistency. This consistency is crucial for developing a comprehensive model that integrates medical, psychological, and social aspects. At the same time, the MMO ensures seamless interoperability with technical systems, sensors, and other relevant areas such as health informatics, clinical decision support systems, and biomedical data analysis. This enables the effective integration of data from various sources, including telemedicine, imaging diagnostics, and sensors, significantly improving patient monitoring and treatment. By creating a standardized and unified data foundation in psychiatric research and practice, the MMO lays a crucial cornerstone for personalized medicine through the networking of heterogeneous knowledge bases.

                    Ontologies such as the Mental Functioning Ontology (MFO) and its extension MFO-EM offer a precise way to systematically describe mental functions and emotional states. These ontologies allow for the detailed modeling of complex mental processes, contributing to a more accurate analysis of psychological phenomena. Additionally, the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) provides a hierarchical and dimensional structuring of psychological symptoms, enabling a more nuanced capture of the heterogeneity and complexity of symptomatology. By accounting for fluid transitions between different mental disorders, HiTOP represents a more flexible alternative to traditional categorical models. In line with this approach, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework extends the focus beyond symptomatic criteria by emphasizing biological and psychological constructs to analyze the underlying mechanisms of mental disorders in greater depth. Combining these dimensional and biological approaches allows for a more comprehensive consideration of the causes and effects of mental disorders. The Transdiagnostic Approach to Psychiatric Classification System (TADS) complements these approaches by offering a transdiagnostic perspective that captures both similarities and differences between various disorders. This perspective overcomes the rigid boundaries of traditional classification systems and promotes a more holistic view of mental health.

                    Additionally, the MMO provides an interoperable foundation that enables the systematic integration of sociodemographic and ecological factors through Social-Ecological Systems and Socioeconomic Ontologies. This extension not only enhances the understanding of the social and ecological influences on mental health but also integrates these dimensions more deeply into psychiatric diagnostics and treatment. This way, the complex interactions between social contexts and mental disorders can be captured and incorporated into personalized treatment approaches, leading to more comprehensive and effective patient care.

                    To enable seamless integration into the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) and optimize the connection between various health information systems, the MMO is to be developed into a FHIR extension. This extension will promote interoperability with existing health information systems, improve data integration, and standardize communication between medical and psychiatric institutions. In this way, the Meta Mesh Ontology contributes to the standardization and unification of data in psychiatric research and practice while simultaneously laying the foundation for truly personalized medicine.
